# RNG in Video Games

Published on: 11/08/2023

RNG, short for "random number generation", is a much maligned feature in the topic of video games. It is often invoked like some sort of chaotic god ruling over the game, randomly deciding who will win, and who won't make it past the first level.

In this context, _RNG_ can be thought of as game mechanics involving random chance. This can take many forms, such as generating loot from a loot table, or rolling the dice to pass an ability check.
